🌐 My Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This is a collection of hands-on projects and learnings from my internship — a peek into my adventures in the fascinating world of cybersecurity.

👋 A Bit About Me

Hey there! I'm a cybersecurity intern with a passion for ethical hacking, securing networks, and digging into vulnerabilities. Think of this repo as a snapshot of my journey so far — filled with real-world tasks, tools, and the lessons that came with them.

🛠️ What I’ve Been Working On

🔍 Web Application Security

Explored web apps to uncover vulnerabilities and understand how to secure them.

Worked with OWASP Top 10 concepts and turned theory into practical experience.

🌐 Network Scanning & Enumeration

Mapped out networks and identified potential weak spots.

Practiced stealthy scanning and information gathering in safe, lab environments.

📶 Wireless Network Security

Experimented with Wi-Fi security, learning how to analyze and strengthen wireless networks.

Tested WPA/WPA2 protections to better understand encryption flaws and how to prevent attacks.

🧰 My Toolkit

Burp Suite – For poking around and testing web applications.

Nmap – My go-to for scanning networks and discovering open doors.

Aircrack-ng Suite – For learning how wireless attacks work (and how to defend against them!).

📁 Repo Structure

🚫 A Quick Note

This portfolio was created strictly for educational and ethical purposes. All testing was done in safe environments or with full permission. I’m a firm believer in responsible hacking — always stay legal, always stay ethical.
